# rpg-python
A Breakable Toy to learn Python by way of a console RPG.

# Intro
This project is from 2012: it was my second Breakable Toy and was used to learn Python. (See [Python Food Planner](https://github.com/guturner/food-planner) for my first Breakable Toy.)

**It does not represent my current knowledge of Python or programming best practices.**

Demonstrates knowledge of:
* Python
* File IO

# How to Run
`python '.\Object RPG.py'`

# Lessons Learned
* Do not place all project code in one file!
